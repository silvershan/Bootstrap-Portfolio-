          <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Michigan near the city of Ann Arbor.  I spent all my time as a kid at my grandpa's, riding tractors and learning all there was to know about farm life.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When I went off to college I decided to stay close and attended Michigan State University.  I graduated with a major in Human Biology and minor in Nutritional Sciences.  I had originally wanted to go to medical school but quickly decided this was not the route I wanted to take.</p>
          <br>
          <p>My senior year of college I decided I wanted to become a naturopath.  The best school was out in Seattle so my boyfriend and I moved cross country for me to attend school.  Following my second year, I decided this was not my passion either.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After learning deeply about what I like and do not like in a career field I met with my aunt who is a web developer.  She showed me some of what she does and taught me a little about coding and I was hooked!  I am so excited to be a part of this career field now and am so excited to learn!</p>
